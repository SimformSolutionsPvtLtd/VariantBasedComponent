## Project Desctiption

A VariantBasedComponent boilerplate to kickstart your project with some commonly used setups, components, navigation and screens.

## Prerequisites

**iOS** : XCode(15) onwards

**Android** : Android Studio Flamingo(2022.2.1) with gradle(7.2) onwards

**Editor** : Visual Studio Code

## How to Run the Project

1. Open the project directory in to terminal
2. Run and build for either OS

   - Run iOS app

     ```bash
     yarn run ios
     ```

   - Run Android app

     ```bash
     yarn run android
     ```

   - Note: This yarn scripts will lint your code first. If there are no lint errors, then it will run the ios or android app. Otherwise it will show the lint errors in the terminal.

## Coding Style used

This project adheres to JavaScript Standard for coding style. To maintain coding standards, utilizing features of ES6 and follow best development practices of react-native, this project also uses [ES6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants), some rules of [eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/eslint-config), [import-resolver-typescript](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-import-resolver-typescript) and [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import).

**Do not disable lint inside the code. Try to understand the rule and then follow it into your code. Disabling lint will be considered a violation of coding standards. Exceptions will be allowed by the code-reviewer and team lead after understanding the need to ignore lint.**

1. **To Lint**

   Use the yarn script `lint`. To run it

```bash
  yarn lint
```

2. **Auto Lint on Commit**

   This is implemented using [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky). So husky will prevent code-commits having lint errors. There is no additional setup needed.

3. **Understanding Linting Errors**

   The linting rules are from JS Standard and React-Standard. [Regular JS errors can be found with descriptions here](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/), while [React errors and descriptions can be found here](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react).

## Extra steps for android

_Describe any extra steps which need to be taken for the auto-generated android project. Eg. Some specific setup of any manifest file, some manual linking which is buggy and needs to be corrected for first checkout etc. Here is an example:_

- Mind the version of google services used in the project. All google services must have same version. This is implemented using project level build.gradle.

## Extra steps for ios

_Describe any extra steps which need to be taken for the auto-generated ios project. Eg. Some specific setup of any certificates, pods, linking, information in Info.plist, some manual linking which is buggy and needs to be corrected for first checkout etc. Here is an example:_

- You will need all the certificates to run the ios project in a real device.
